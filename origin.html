            <h1>Their Stories</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> My mother, father, siblings, and I had been living in a poor part of town in Guadalajara, Mexico. My father worked as a ranchero and my mother used to waitress at a local pub and restaurant. I was the oldest of all my siblings and therefore, the leader. I had to set an example for the younger ones and had to take care of them from the dangers of the world. One day, I was at home when I found out my father had been killed. It was a tragic day and my mother, devastated from the loss, wanted to move to America, speaking of being safer there and how America could help us all. We moved the following week, wanting to leave Guadalajara and the crime of the small town. We were missed and there was no one else to care after the ranch since my father died, so they closed it down, but it was necessary.

            <p>I came to the US almost 2 years ago. We came to look for a better place to live. It took us a while to adapt because it’s all different from food, school, culture and celebrations. Living in another country has many advantages, like getting to know a new country and new people, getting in contact with other languages, learning more about other cultures and also the safety here is much better. One of the worst things about living in another country is missing family and friends.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>My father was a bracero. He suffered a lot. He was far from his family in Mexico but convinced a good religious man to build a home for his family and brought his family home to the United States. Years later, my mother cleaned others people’s homes and ironed other people’s clothes: neighbors’ homes and clothes, in a middle class neighborhood in a home my father purchased. I stand proud every day because of them. I am proud to be an immigrant.
